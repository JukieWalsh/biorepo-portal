Protocols
=========

Generally, Protocols are the starting point of a workflow for a user when
using the Biorepository Portal. Protocols organize Organizations, Data Sources,
and Protocol Users to facilitate downstream workflows.

Each Protocol has an immutable key associated with it which facilitates a Group
namespace in the eHB.

* **Name**: A unique Protocol name.
* **Data Sources**: Protocol Data Sources that are associated with the Protocol
* **Protocol Users**: Users that are associated with the Protocol.
* **Organizations**: Organizations that are associated with the Protocol.
